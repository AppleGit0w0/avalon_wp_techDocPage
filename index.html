				<p>
					Kaedehara Kazuha (Japanese: 楓かえで原はら万かず葉は Kaedehara Kazuha) 
					is a playable Anemo character in Genshin Impact. A wandering samurai 
					of the once-famed Kaedehara Clan with an ability to read the sounds 
					of nature, Kazuha is a temporary crewmember of The Crux. 
					Despite being burdened by the many happenings of his past, 
					Kazuha still maintains an easygoing disposition.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-section with-border" id="personality">
				<header class="header02">Personality</header>
				<p>
					Kazuha is a polite and well-spoken person. 
					Unlike other noble Inazuman clan members, he prefers going out 
					and traveling rather than staying put indoors, something that he 
					is able to do due to the seizure of his clan home. He once roamed 
					Inazuma peacefully as a modest wanderer for a good portion of his 
					life, teaching himself bladework and picking up other skills. Never 
					seeking luxury, he is instead easily pleased just by sleeping on a 
					sun-warmed rock. The time he has spent outdoors makes him attuned 
					to nature and the wind, being able to "hear" and "smell" everything 
					around him with absolute clarity. He can sense dangers, read people 
					and track them down in an instant no matter how well they try to 
					conceal it. Due to this sensitivity he prefers calm weather and never 
					stays in one place for too long, having trouble sleeping for the former 
					and having his skills stagnate for the latter.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kazuha firmly believes that everyone is entitled to their hopes and 
					dreams and that no one has the right to take them, not even a god. 
					For this reason, he opposes the Raiden Shogun and those who support her. 
					Despite his values, he isn't prideful and can acknowledge the strong fighting 
					prowess and honorable conduct of those he personally disagrees with. He sees 
					his friend's duel as honorable and noble, but also considers his subsequent 
					execution by the Shogun to be both fair and justified. Kazuha is determined 
					in his goals, pursuing them with thoroughness and cunning, but he also takes his 
					time and is easygoing. He is very reflective and thoughtful about all matters, 
					frequently pondering about various topics in his travels. He holds his relationships 
					in high regard, immediately coming out of hiding for his friend and forever grateful 
					to Beidou and Gorou for taking him in when he needed shelter. Kazuha frequently warns 
					others of coming storms and possible trouble. He happily does simple errands, offers 
					advice, and is willing to help others.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the death of his friend and joining the Crux he was quiet and wouldn't speak
					to any of his crewmates, but he eventually warmed up to them and according to Beidou 
					is fairly chatty. Kazuha has a poetic side and enjoys penning haikus, though he claims 
					to not be especially talented at it. As a result of both traveling many places and 
					sailing for long periods of time, Kazuha has grown particularly fond of readily available 
					grilled fish and takes the time to prepare and finish his food slowly. While he is not picky 
					about what he eats, he does not appreciate rushed meals or lazy cooking methods. His most 
					prized possession is his sword that he keeps with him at all times, a source of pride for 
					Kazuha as both an Inazuman and a samurai. He is also incredibly fond of red maple leaves, 
					finding them beautiful and enjoys seeing them rain during autumn. When unable to view such 
					sights, he frequently collects and carries them as a memento to ease any homesickness.

					Kazuha uses the medium male model. He has platinum blonde hair with a single orange-red 
					streak on his right. He has red eyes with a yellow hue at the bottom.

					Enchanted by the Birds and Blossoms, He Wanders the Moonlit Path
				</p>
				<p>
					If one's heart is empty, all under heaven is empty.
					But if one's heart is pure, all under heaven is pure.
					- Kazuha's Musings
				</p>
				<p>
					A wandering samurai from Inazuma with a modest and gentle personality.
				</p>
				<p>
					Beneath a youthful and carefree demeanor lies a heart that hides a great many burdens 
					from the past. Seemingly easygoing, Kazuha has his own code of conduct.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kazuha leads a wandering life, setting out on his journey in the day, and sleeps with the sky 
					as his blanket and earth as his bed in the night. Wealth has never been his pursuit, and regardless 
					of summer or winter, what he seeks has always been true peace in his heart. Despite the wilderness 
					being his home, he never worries about the impending rain or storm. It is as if rainstorms are afraid 
					of him, because they do not dare to cross his path.
				</p>
				<p>
					Out of curiosity, someone asked about this talent and Kazuha answered with absolute honesty — reading 
					the sounds of nature is a unique ability of his. People do not usually pay attention to the weather, 
					so it is no surprise that they are unable to discover the signs it reveals. However, given Kazuha's 
					skill, he can sense the arrival of snow and rain immediately with just a gust of wind or abnormal 
					humidity. That is when he knows it's time to seek shelter.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kazuha, who has traversed around the lands, has avoided countless torrents of storms and flashes of 
					lightning. This time, however, what awaits him will be an unprecedented thunderstorm. This time, he 
					will no longer seek refuge. He, the rain, and the lightning will meet at the intersection of fate, 
					as destiny marks it.
				</p>
				<p>
					"—— I hear a storm strike far and distant, with only a whisper light and faint. From the sky there 
					falls no rain, thus here I shall still remain."
